## Description
My name is Gael Barranco. I am a third year Mechancial Engineer student at Georgia Tech. 
I've dipped my toes in undergraduate research in carbon fiber reinforced composites and metal 3D printing.
Additionally, I have worked with ATA Engineering as a structural analysis intern.
My interests lie in helping people in unconventional ways, especially through wearable robotics and prosthetics.
