## Description
My name is Gael Barranco. I am a third year Mechancial Engineer student at Georgia Tech. 
I've dipped my toes in undergraduate research in metal 3D printing and carbon fiber.
I've traveled to the west coast to work with ATA Engineering as a structural analysis intern.
I've set sail across the pond, seeing much of Europe.
My interests lie in helping people in unconventional ways, particularly through wearable robotics and prosthetics.
